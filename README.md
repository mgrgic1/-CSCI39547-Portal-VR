VR Project

Initial Commit (9/13/20):

Import all of these files into Unity. Once the project is imported and Unity is open, open the "test scene". This will be in the Scenes folder. If you have a PS4 controller, plug it in. Once this scene is open, you should see a basic platform, and a basic character. Press Play to run the scene. The controls are configurd for PS4 and PC.

PS4 Controls:

Left stick - movement

X (hold) - sprint

Square - jump

PC Controls:

WASD - movement

Space - Jump

Left Shift - Sprint

This scene is just for testing/reviewing new implementations. The controls will be updated as we add more functionality.
